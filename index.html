    <b>  Young Cyranical- What Are We </b>

    <p>
        Aye aye aye she told me what are we? 
        I coud'nt give an answer 
        Instead I hugged her real tight and I kissed here 
        She told that she loved me, but I went under the weather
        I tucked in all cold and lonely I popped them pills and then they put me out in a jiffy
    </p>

    Ha, Your Name Your Name Your Name
    Swirling on my dreams all day
    Im confused if I want you at bay
    Emotions telling me to obey 
    But I want a free will 
    So I didn’t call  even for the chills

    Yeah my heart beating faster, my blood getting colder 
    I might pass out if I can't hold her 
    I'm so confused maybe I don't wanna see her
    Her words got me feeling bolder
    But I can't let her phase me, 
    Cause I'm tougher than a boulder

        At the the same time her words put  me under the weather
        Broke my exteriors
        Made me confused of my decisions 
        And my thoughts done scattered
        And my heart all bruised up and battered 
        Man what are we the question got staggered
    </p>

     Aye aye aye she told me what are we?

    I tucked in all cold and lonely I popped them pills and then they put me out in a jiffy
